<i>Abstract</i>-Recent advances in wireless communication and 
electronic manufacture have enabled a variety of sensors to be
used for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). With these
sensors, WBAN can monitor and feedback real-time sensor data
for human health monitoring, sports training and interactive
environment. But the high dynamic of human movement has
been a hard rock on the way of the development of WBAN,
which leads to changeful network topology. In this paper, a
multi-hop prototype WBAN has been built for characterizing
the network connectivity during human motions. A probability
based routing protocol fusing inertial sensor data and history link
quality is then developed, which aims at taking into count the
high spatio-temporal change of WBAN topology on the selection
of a reliable relay node in WBAN routing. Compared with a
number of existing routing, the proposal protocol can provide
better performance in terms of packet delay and delivery ratio.
Hence, this kind of routing being aware of human behavior by
using inertial sensors is more promising for real-time on body
system.
